# Customer-Conversion-Prediction


# Project Description :

In this project. We're going to predict if the customer will subscribe to our term insurance or not in telephonic marketing campaign using Machine Learning Models.

# Project Approach :

In this project, I used googleColab  as IDE for Python Programming Language.

# Project In-Detailed :

# Step 1:  Understanding the whole dataset.
First and foremost we need to understand the concept of the data. In this Customer Conversion Prediction this is an logistics regression based problem in that It has an target variable so, it is classification problem . In class it is Binary classification problem.


# Step 2:  Importing all the necessary python libraries.
Import all the necessary libraries.


# Step 3:  Loading the dataset.
After importing all the necessary packages. Next step is to load the Data by using .csv Format.


# Step 4:  Data cleaning.
In this step, we understand more about the data and prepare it for further analysis. Cleaning data essentially means removing discrepancies from data such as missing fields, improper values, setting the right format of the data, structuring data from raw files.


# Step 5:  Exploratory Data Analysis.
This EDA is the backbone of data science. To analyz  and investigate the data sets and summarize their main characteristics. By using data visualization methods. 
And handling outliers in this method I have  used box plot.


# Step 6:  Encoding the data.
The process of converting the categorical features into numeric features.

 
#  Step 7:  Splitting and Scaling the data.
We used SMOTE method because this whole data set is imbalanced.
And Splitted the data into train and test splitting.

For Scaling purpose I used Standard scaler.


# Step 8:  Model.
In this step,3 Machine learning models used. 

•	Logistic Regression.
•	Random forest classifier.
•	XGboost classifier.


# Step 9: Conclusion.
Based on the model Evaluation.Got the good score.
